MADE SOME CHANGES 
the stylus works on the basis of RF communication

make sure of the following while testing the stylus:-
1. the stylus has charge
2. the slave Arduino is connected to the smartboard
3. the correct "com" port is added to the pyserial code
4. the pyserial code is running --- incase it throws permission error, make sure the Arduino IDE is shut.
